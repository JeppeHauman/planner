# Planner


Planner is an application designed for employers who need an efficient way to manage employee shifts. With Planner, employers can easily create employee profiles and set up shifts, which can then be placed on a calendar for quick reference. To ensure the security of employee data, the application requires employers to log in using their Github or Google accounts. This allows for a streamlined and hassle-free login process, while also providing an extra layer of protection for sensitive information. Whether you're managing a small team or a large workforce, Planner makes it easy to keep track of employee schedules and streamline your day-to-day operations.
